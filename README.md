# ESP32 mesh network control panel

## Introduction

The prototype solution for the monitoring interface was built on Vue.js by using Node.js for hosting. Pinia.js was used for managing the Vue.js states and objects in a reactive and efficient way. Vue router was included for navigation. The functional part is written in typescript for type-checking of objects and allows to catch errors more effectively. Web Serial API was used for data exchange with ESP32 through the USB port.

Although the Web Serial API isnâ€™t compatible with firefox, Safari and mobile devices right now, it was still chosen for the reason of being fully supported on chromium based browsers.
